The sizzling comes from a hot iron plate where you will find all your ingredients like buff, veggies, fries, rice or mash… just before it hits your table, the chef/sous chef pours a delicious sauce onto the food plated up. When the sauce hits the hot pan, it sizzles sending throes of smoke around you whose subtle and not so subtle aroma hits your nose making your mouth water.\nA wide variety of small crustaceans, tiny relatives of buff.

The sizzling sound you hear when the yummy and spicy sauce is cascaded on the pile of spiced rice or noodles revels your penchant over the food for sure!\n\nThe juiciness of the steak that is served in hot sizzler plate comes from the high heat which leaves the insides tender but the outside near to being crispy. Cutlets/patties or cottage cheese steaks can also be used for its vegetarian version. Rice served as the main portion of the sizzler plate is either plain steamed or a deliciously flavoured pilaf. Roasted, pan seared or grilled veggies provide a luscious accompaniment along. The sauce that is served is based on Worchestire, chilli garlic, or a tomato based coulis. The serving plate is heated to red hot and then the pilaf, veggies and steaks are placed, topping it with sauces that is left fizzling as you gorge on it without waste of time!\n\nSome say this was initially invented in Japan and the resemblance of the recipe travelled to the USA after the World war II, where it became very popular there after, by the Steak House Industry.
